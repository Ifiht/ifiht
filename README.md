# Overview
Hi! I'm an infrastructure, software, and security IT type who enjoys building things with computers. Feel free to collaborate or open issues on anything you see here. Currently a lot of my work is going into patching Minecraft server code to add features and improve parallel-processing function, and building out my cognitive agent projects. Some interesting facts about me:
- Joined Github on [October 1st, 2014](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_1)
- Longtime member of [Telehack](https://telehack.com/u/ifiht)
- Server admin of [I√∞av√∂llr](https://ithavollr.github.io/)
